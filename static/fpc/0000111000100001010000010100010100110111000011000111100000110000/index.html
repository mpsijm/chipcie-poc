							After breaking into the database of the TU Delft and releasing sensitive information to
							the public, Anton the cyber criminal got the CIA looking for him. After being arrested,
							Anton was transported to the heavily guarded prison Alcatraz. Disabling the security
							system was a piece of cake, so he could easily get outside of the prison walls. However,
							behind these walls a number of guards are positioned and they will immediately sound
							the alarm if they spot any escaped prisoner.
							<br><br>
							To escape, Anton needs to cross a field with width
							10 and height 10 that is being guarded by 3 guards.
							He starts
							at position (0, 0) and can only escape if he reaches
							position (10, 10) without being spotted. Some
							guards have better views than others, so every of
							the three guards has an associated range of view.
							If the distance between Anton and a guard is less
							than that guard's view range,
							then the guard will sound the alarm and Anton 
							will return to his cell.
							<br><br>
							Your job is now to find out whether Anton can
							escape Alcatraz or if he cannot escape without being
							spotted. 
						</p>

						<h2>Input</h2>
						<p>
							A file containing multiple setups of initial positions for the
							three guards. One setup consists of three lines with
							each line containing a guard's X, Y, and view radius R as
							integers from 1-9.
						</p>
						<h2>Output</h2>
						<p>
							A string containing a character 0 or 1 for each setup. If
							it is possible to escape the setup, then the
							character is a 1, else 0. Your output should contain
							lines/3 characters.
